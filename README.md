# Commodity Exchange Market [Hackathon]

> Implement a Web Based solution through which farmers can participate
in a commodity exchange market. The solution should explain the
process involved and the benefits of commodity exchange to the user.
The purpose of such an exchange is to provide a centralized marketplace
where commodity producers can sell their commodities to those who
want to use them for manufacturing or consumption. The solution should
enable farmers to create independent accounts and interact with dealers
to avail the best profits and deals.
